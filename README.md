# MNISTFlaskApp

## My First flask app. 
This was basically an exercise to learn Python, Sklearn, Google Cloud Platform, git in terminal, glt, working with resizing and flattening image data, and flask. While it's a small application, I learned a lot.

The handwritten digit recognition was written with the flask microframework, and backed with a RandomForests model trained on the MNIST dataset. Simply draw a single digit number, click predict, and watch as the app generates a prediction.

The front end was a flask modified from the html and stylesheets found here:

And I built and trained the model with a little help from this book:
